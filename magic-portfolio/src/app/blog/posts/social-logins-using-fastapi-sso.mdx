Social login is no longer a luxuryâ€”itâ€™s an expectation. Whether you're building a SaaS dashboard, a personal blog, or a full-fledged automation platform, enabling users to authenticate via trusted providers like Google or GitHub can dramatically improve onboarding and engagement.

In this post, weâ€™ll walk through how to implement social login in FastAPI using [`fastapi-sso`](https://github.com/tomasvotava/fastapi-sso), a lightweight and extensible library that makes OAuth2 integration refreshingly simple.

## Why Social Login?

Social login offers a frictionless authentication experience. Instead of creating new credentials, users can log in with accounts they already trust. Benefits include:

- âœ… Faster onboarding
- âœ… Verified identity from providers
- âœ… Easier integration with user profiles (name, email, avatar)
- âœ… Fewer passwords to manage

## Getting Started

Before we dive into code, make sure you have:

- Python 3.8+
- FastAPI installed
- OAuth credentials from your provider (e.g., Google, GitHub)
- Basic familiarity with FastAPI routing

Install the library:

<CodeBlock className="my-24"
    compact
    codeInstances={[
        {
            code: 'pip install fastapi-sso',
            label: 'Terminal',
            language: 'bash'
        },
    ]}
    copyButton
/>

Or with poetry:

<CodeBlock className="my-24"
    compact
    codeInstances={[
        {
            code: 'poetry add fastapi-sso',
            label: 'Poetry',
            language: 'bash'
        },
    ]}
    copyButton
/>

## Setting Up Google Login

Letâ€™s use Google as our example provider. First, create OAuth credentials in the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/):

- Set redirect URI to: `http://localhost:8000/auth/callback`
- Note your `client_id` and `client_secret`

Now initialize the provider:

<CodeBlock className="my-24"
    compact
    codeInstances={[
        {
            code: `from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from fastapi_sso.sso.google import GoogleSSO

app = FastAPI()

google_sso = GoogleSSO(
    client_id="your-client-id",
    client_secret="your-client-secret",
    redirect_uri="http://localhost:8000/auth/callback"
)`,
            label: 'main.py',
            language: 'python'
        },
    ]}
    copyButton
/>

## Creating Login and Callback Routes

<CodeBlock className="my-24"
    compact
    codeInstances={[
        {
            code: `from fastapi.responses import RedirectResponse

@app.get("/auth/login")
async def login():
    return await google_sso.get_login_redirect()

@app.get("/auth/callback")
async def callback(request: Request):
    async with google_sso:
        user = await google_sso.verify_and_process(request)
    return {"user": user}`,
            label: 'main.py',
            language: 'python'
        },
    ]}
    copyButton
/>

> ðŸ”’ **Note:** As of version `0.16.0`, you must use `async with` to avoid race conditions when verifying the login flow.

## Supported Providers

`fastapi-sso` supports a wide range of providers out of the box:

- Google
- GitHub
- Facebook
- Microsoft
- LinkedIn
- Discord
- Spotify
- Notion
- Twitter (X)
- And more...

You can also define custom providers using the generic SSO class.

## Testing the Flow

Run your FastAPI app:

<CodeBlock className="my-24"
    compact
    codeInstances={[
        {
            code: 'uvicorn main:app --reload',
            label: 'Terminal',
            language: 'bash'
        },
    ]}
    copyButton
/>

Visit `http://localhost:8000/auth/login` in your browser. Youâ€™ll be redirected to Google, and upon successful login, receive a JSON response with your user info.

## Best Practices

- âœ… Validate returned user data before creating sessions
- âœ… Store provider identities securely in your database
- âœ… Use HTTPS in production
- âœ… Handle edge cases like denied permissions or expired tokens

## Final Thoughts

With `fastapi-sso`, adding social login to your FastAPI app is not only possibleâ€”itâ€™s elegant. Whether you're building a user-facing product or an internal automation tool, this library helps you authenticate users securely and efficiently.

If you're planning to persist provider identities, issue your own access tokens, or integrate this into a larger workflow, Iâ€™d love to help you scaffold that logic next.
