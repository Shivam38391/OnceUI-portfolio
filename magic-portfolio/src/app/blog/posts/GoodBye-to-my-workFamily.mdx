It feels strange to be leaving my job. It’s more than just quitting a company; it feels like moving away from a second home. I'm excited about my new start, but it’s hard because of the truly great people I’m leaving behind.

## The Joyful Bonds
For the past few years, our office was just as much a place for friendship as it was for work. I was so lucky to find some of the kindest, most beautiful-hearted friends anyone could ask for. We shared all the highs and lows—the excitement of finishing a big project, the stress of a last-minute fix, and all the funny, silly moments that made the hard days easy.

I’ll especially miss our lunch times, where we’d gather to talk absolute nonsense and endlessly make fun of whoever brought the weirdest food that day. 🤣

## A Priceless Takeaway
To all my friends and teammates: you did so much more than just help me with my career. You made every day better, kinder, and happier. The friendships we built are the most important thing I take away from this experience—a treasure much bigger than any job success.

Thank you for everything: the memories, the laughs, and for always having my back. I know this isn't the real goodbye.

# A Farewell Poem (Shayri):
# राह-ए-उल्फ़त में बिछड़ना तो ज़रूरी ठहरा,
# पर यादों का सफ़र कहाँ पूरा हुआ करता है।

# (Transliteration: Raah-e-ulfat mein bichhadna toh zaroori thehra,
# Par yaadon ka safar kahan poora hua karta hai.)


# Meaning: Separation is inevitable on the journey of friendship,
# But the journey of memories never truly ends.
