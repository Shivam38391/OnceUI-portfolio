Running database services in **Docker containers** is a modern best practice that offers consistency, isolation, and easy cleanup. We'll use **Docker Compose** to launch both PostgreSQL (the database) and **pgAdmin** (the web management interface) with a single command. 




## Prerequisites

You'll need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine. You can check your installation by running:

<CodeBlock compact marginBottom="16" codes={[
{
code: "docker --version\ndocker compose version",
language: "bash"
}
]} />

## Defining Services in docker-compose.yml

Create a file named docker-compose.yml in your project root. This configuration defines the two services, ensuring they can communicate with each other using their service names (postgres and pgadmin).

<CodeBlock className="my-24"
compact
codes={[
{
code: `version: '3.8'

services:

1. PostgreSQL Database Service

postgres:
image: postgres:14-alpine
container_name: postgres_db
restart: always
ports:
# Exposes database port to host
- "5432:5432"
environment:
# --- Database Credentials ---
POSTGRES_USER: dev_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD: secret_password
POSTGRES_DB: my_app_db
volumes:
# Persistence: Saves data to your local machine
- postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

2. pgAdmin Web Interface Service

pgadmin:
image: dpage/pgadmin4:latest
container_name: pgadmin_web
restart: always
ports:
# Exposes pgAdmin web interface
- "5050:80"
environment:
# --- pgAdmin Login Credentials ---
PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: admin@local.com
PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: pgadmin_password
depends_on:
- postgres

Define the volume for data persistence

volumes:
postgres_data:
`,
label: 'docker-compose.yml',
language: 'yaml'
},

🔑 Key Configuration Notes

Service Name as Host: When connecting pgAdmin to the database, you will use the host name postgres, as this is the internal service name.

Ports: We use 5432:5432 for the database and 5050:80 for pgAdmin access.

Launch and Access the Services

Step 1: Launch Containers

Start the services in detached mode (background):

<CodeBlock compact marginBottom="16" codes={[
{
code: "docker compose up -d",
language: "bash"
}
]} />

## Step 2: Access pgAdmin

Open your web browser and navigate to: http://localhost:5050. Log in using the PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL (admin@local.com) and PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD (pgadmin_password).

## Step 3: Register the PostgreSQL Server

Inside pgAdmin, you need to register the database server using the following connection details:

Host name/address: postgres

Port: 5432

Maintenance database: my_app_db

Username: dev_user

Password: secret_password

You'll be connected and ready to manage your database tables and schemas right from the web interface!

Stopping and Cleaning Up

When finished, you can safely stop the services:

<CodeBlock compact marginBottom="16" codes={[
{
code: "docker compose stop",
language: "bash"
}
]} />

To remove containers, network, and the persistent data volume (for a fresh start):

<CodeBlock compact codes={[
{
code: "docker compose down --volumes",
language: "bash"
}
]} />
