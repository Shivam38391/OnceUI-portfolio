Running database services in **Docker containers** is a modern best practice that offers consistency, isolation, and easy cleanup. We'll use **Docker Compose** to launch both PostgreSQL (the database) and **pgAdmin** (the web management interface) with a single command. 




## Prerequisites

You'll need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine. You can check your installation by running:

<CodeBlock compact marginBottom="16" codes={[
{
code: "docker --version\ndocker compose version",
language: "bash"
}
]} />

## Defining Services in docker-compose.yml

Create a file named docker-compose.yml in your project root. This configuration defines the two services, ensuring they can communicate with each other using their service names (postgres and pgadmin).

<CodeBlock className="my-24"
compact
codes={[
{
code: `
version: '3.8'

services:
  # 1. PostgreSQL Database Service
  postgres:
    image: postgres:14-alpine # Using a lightweight stable image
    container_name: postgres_db
    restart: always
    ports:
      # Maps local port 5432 to container port 5432
      - "5432:5432"
    environment:
      # --- Database Configuration ---
      POSTGRES_USER: user_name
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: my_strong_password
      POSTGRES_DB: dev_database

    # Optional: Volume for persistent data
    # This saves your data even if the container is stopped or removed.
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  # 2. pgAdmin Web Interface Service
  pgadmin:
    image: dpage/pgadmin4:latest # Use the latest official pgAdmin image
    container_name: pgadmin_web
    restart: always
    ports:
      # Maps local port 5050 to container port 80 (pgAdmin's default)
      - "5050:80"
    environment:
      # --- pgAdmin Login Credentials (NOT the DB credentials) ---
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: user@example.com
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: pgadmin_password

    # Ensure pgAdmin can communicate with the Postgres container
    depends_on:
      - postgres

# Define the volume for data persistence
volumes:
  postgres_data:

🔑 Key Configuration Notes

Service Name as Host: When connecting pgAdmin to the database, you will use the host name postgres, as this is the internal service name.

Ports: We use 5432:5432 for the database and 5050:80 for pgAdmin access.

Launch and Access the Services

## Step 1: Launch Containers

Start the services in detached mode (background):

<CodeBlock compact marginBottom="16" codes={[
{
code: "docker compose up -d",
language: "bash"
}
]} />

## Step 2: Access pgAdmin

Open your web browser and navigate to: http://localhost:5050. Log in using the PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL (admin@local.com) and PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD (pgadmin_password).

## Step 3: Register the PostgreSQL Server

Inside pgAdmin, you need to register the database server using the following connection details:

Host name/address: postgres

Port: 5432

Maintenance database: my_app_db

Username: dev_user

Password: secret_password

You'll be connected and ready to manage your database tables and schemas right from the web interface!

Stopping and Cleaning Up

When finished, you can safely stop the services:

<CodeBlock compact marginBottom="16" codes={[
{
code: "docker compose stop",
language: "bash"
}
]} />

To remove containers, network, and the persistent data volume (for a fresh start):

<CodeBlock compact codes={[
{
code: "docker compose down --volumes",
language: "bash"
}
]} />
